# Working on Claude Graft

## Style, first

Comments say **why**, never what. Delete a comment that restates the line under it.

    // WRONG — increments the counter
    failures += 1

    // RIGHT — a refused call retried on the next tick becomes 120 attempts an
    // hour, which is how a client earns a rate limit rather than avoids one.
    failures += 1

Prose in the README, not bullet lists. Tests read as sentences — `check(…, "a
profile with no stored login has no token")`, not `"testTokenNil"`.

Nothing that leaves this machine may name a tool, a model or a pipeline. That
includes commit messages, the README and anything pushed. Write what a person
would have written by hand.

## Commands

    ./build.sh                 app + launcher into build/, this arch only
    GRAFT_UNIVERSAL=1 ./build.sh   both arches, joined with lipo
    ./test.sh                  200 checks, all in a throwaway directory
    ./release.sh [--install]   tests, builds universal, draws the icon, signs, packages

## Invariants

**Never touch an app Graft did not create.** Bundles are identified by the
`graft.json` they carry, never by name. `Claude` and `Claude Graft` are reserved
names. This rule exists because an earlier version matched on name and deleted
`/Applications/Claude.app`.

**Never destroy what a profile owns.** Anything a link replaces is moved to a
hidden `.<name>.graft-own` sibling first, and restored when the shortcut goes
back to its own chats. A profile must never be grafted from itself — guarded in
`graft`, `relink` and `install`, because self-grafting stashes away every file
the profile has and leaves links pointing at their own names.

**A stash already sitting there is not proof of a duplicate.** Claude writes
`config.json`, and recreates chat directories, by renaming a temporary over
them, and a rename leaves a real file where the symlink was. The profile then
goes back to writing its own copy while the stash still holds the pre-graft
state. `stash` used to read that as drift and delete it, which threw away every
chat written since the graft; it now folds the two together and keeps the copy
the profile is actually using. `unstash` used to bail whenever something already
sat at the link, which is what left the stash there to arm the next graft.

**An unreadable `config.json` is not an empty one.** A profile that has never
been signed in has no file at all and can share the whole store safely. A file
that will not parse is one caught mid-rename, and treating that as "no account,
so the same account as the source" linked an entire store away. `readableConfigJSON`
tells the two apart; nothing may write that file, or decide where a profile's
chats go, without asking it.

**Credentials are borrowed, never taken.** Only the access token is decrypted,
never the refresh token: Anthropic rotates those and using one signs Claude
Desktop out. Nothing is written back to Claude's config, cookies or keychain.
The token goes to `api.anthropic.com` and nowhere else.

**The keychain is asked once, and only when asking is the way through.** Every
read tries silently first, so a build already on the item's ACL never sees a
dialog no matter who asked. When that read comes back shut the app asks rather
than falling back without saying why — once for the life of the process, never
again after a decline, and not while it is coming up hidden into the menu bar,
since a dialog thrown over a login is answered by nobody. The rule is
`ClaudeCredentials.mayRaiseDialog`, kept pure so the suite can drive it;
`UsageMonitor.mayPromptUnasked` carries the login case.

`SecKeychainSetUserInteractionAllowed` is what actually makes a read silent. The
`LAContext` the compiler suggests in its place governs items backed by an access
control, not an ACL of trusted applications, and was measured sailing straight
past the suppression and putting a dialog on screen from a background poll —
which is what the old "background polls never prompt" rule believed it had.

**Only a person starts a session.** `SessionStarter.start` runs because a
button was pressed and for no other reason: it defaults to non-interactive, so
a call from anywhere unaudited fails quietly instead of raising a keychain
prompt, and it claims the profile for the length of the call so the window and
the dropdown cannot both start the same account. The suite reads
`Sources/App/*.swift` and fails if a fourth caller appears or if `startSession`
turns up on a line with `onAppear`, `onReceive` or a timer — a view refreshes
every thirty seconds, and a session wired into one would open a five-hour
window on every account, over and over.

**⌘Q does not quit.** `applicationShouldTerminate` cancels an unasked-for
terminate and closes the window instead, because the menu bar item is the part
that does the reporting and closing a window is not asking for it to stop.
`AppDelegate.quit()`, wired only to Quit in the dropdown, is what really ends
it, along with a logout — refusing that stalls the shutdown on a dialog. The
rule lives in `QuitPolicy` so the suite can drive it, and its last clause is
the way out: with nothing actually in the bar, `MenuBarController.isShowing`
reads false and a quit is a quit. Ask that, not the setting; the setting says
what was wanted, not whether the bar had room.

**The version is written down once.** `VERSION` at the repo root, stamped into
the bundle by `build.sh`. `Resources/Info.plist` carries `0.0.0` and nothing
else, so a bundle still holding that number was never stamped; the suite fails
if the real number reappears there. `release.sh` refuses to build a version
whose tag already exists — two binaries answering to one number is a thing no
update feed can tell apart, and it is only noticed after the upload.

**A release carries both architectures.** `build.sh` compiles one slice per
architecture and `lipo`s them; a plain `./build.sh` stays single-slice because a
development build only has to run here. `release.sh` sets `GRAFT_UNIVERSAL=1`
and then asks the bundle what it actually got, because an Intel Mac handed an
arm64-only app reports nothing more useful than a bounce in the Dock.

**Profile folders are validated.** One plain component inside Application
Support, never `Claude`, never a path. Without this, typing `Claude` into the
folder field pointed a shortcut at Claude's own profile.

## SwiftUI rules this app learned the hard way

**No `MenuBarExtra`.** Alongside a `WindowGroup` it loops on macOS 26 — every
scene update rebuilds the main menu, which invalidates the scene. 100% CPU and
about a gigabyte a minute, but only while a window is open. Bisected: not the
label, not the content, not the style. The status item is an AppKit
`NSStatusItem` in `MenuBarController`.

**Nothing blocking in a view body.** No filesystem, no process spawn, no
network. `Graft.isRunning` once used `waitUntilExit()` inside a body; that spins
the run loop, re-enters AppKit layout mid-update, and segfaults with a null
program counter. Every process wait now uses a semaphore, and status is read on
a background queue into `@State`.

**Long-lived objects live in `enum Shared`, not `@StateObject` on the App.**
Observing them from the App value invalidates the whole scene on every poll.

## Facts about Claude Desktop that the code depends on

Chat history is `<store>/<accountUuid>/<orgUuid>/`, in both
`claude-code-sessions` and `local-agent-mode-sessions`. An instance reads only
the account it is signed into, so linking a whole store does nothing across two
accounts — the link is made one level deeper, mapping this profile's
`<account>/<org>` onto the source's active one.

Claude launched the ordinary way carries **no `--user-data-dir` at all**, so the
main profile is recognised by the absence of one. Profile paths are prefixes of
each other, so every `pgrep` on `user-data-dir=` must be anchored with
`([[:space:]]|$)` or one instance makes every shorter-named profile look like it
is running.

`config.json` holds `oauth:tokenCacheV2` in Chromium safe storage: keychain item
service `Claude Safe Storage`, account `Claude Key`, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 with salt
`saltysalt` over 1003 iterations, AES-128-CBC, IV of sixteen spaces, `v10`
prefix.

That item's decrypt ACL names each trusted build by code hash, so an ad-hoc
signature earns a fresh entry every time the app is rebuilt — nine entries for
the same `build/Claude Graft.app` path were counted on the development machine,
alongside ten `cdhash:` entries in the item's partition list. A Developer ID
would be one `teamid:` entry that survives every version. Both a suppressed read
and a declined dialog answer `errSecAuthFailed`, so the two are told apart by
which call was made, never by the status.

Live usage is `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` with a bearer
token and `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`. It answers with `five_hour` and
`seven_day` objects carrying `utilization` and `resets_at`, plus
`subscription_type`, a `limits` array of `weekly_scoped` per-model windows, and
`extra_usage` credits. The last two are parsed but not shown anywhere yet.

`plan-usage-history.json` is the fallback: samples of `{t, org, u:{fh, sd}}`
where `fh` is the five-hour percentage used and `sd` the seven-day one, written
only while that instance runs. It is ~180KB and grows, so it is parsed once per
change and cached against modification time and size.

Claude Code's command line keeps **one** login for the whole machine in the
keychain, so `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` does not isolate accounts. That is why Start
Session goes through each profile's own borrowed token rather than the CLI.

## Polling budget

The thirty-second timer reads local files and checks what is running. The API is
asked once per profile per five minutes. Failures back off 60/120/300/900/1800
seconds and a success clears the count; a `Retry-After` from the service wins
and is the one wait a person pressing refresh cannot skip.

## Verification state

Working and checked end to end: shortcut creation, adopting an existing profile,
cross-account chat mapping, live usage for both accounts, memory steady around
106MB at zero idle CPU. Quitting too, from outside: with the item in the bar a
quit is cancelled, the window closes and `mainWindowOpen` goes to 0 with the
process still alive; with `showInMenuBar` off the same quit ends it, so the app
cannot become unquittable. Quit in the dropdown takes the second of those two
paths.

Unproven: **Start Session** has never successfully opened a window. It POSTs one
Haiku message with `max_tokens: 4` and Claude Code's system prompt, which these
tokens are minted for. If that turns out to be wrong the API's own error message
surfaces in the UI rather than being swallowed — read it rather than guessing.

`~/Library/Application Support/ClaudeGraft/usage-status.json` records what each
poll found, including whether the figures came from the API. Read it to check
the state of live usage instead of reading numbers off the screen.
